# Piano Sounds

PianoType.Basic sounds like a MIDI electric piano
PianoType.AM sounds like an organ
PianoType.FM sounds like an even sharper organ. How can I customize this???
PianoType.Sampled_1 are Ron's piano samples (from either Garage Band or PianoTeq).
PianoType.Sampled_2 are from https://github.com/nbrosowsky/tonejs-instruments
