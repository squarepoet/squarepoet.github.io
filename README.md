# Next JS Source Files
This branch contains the Next JS source files for the squarepoet.github.io website.

The mapping is: `HEAD -> next-js-src` => `origin/next-js-src`

When we build, we will output files to `../squarepoet.github.io`

Those files will be checked into the master branch of the GitHub repository, which will trigger the publish action to GitHub pages.
