# Next JS Source Files
This branch contains the Next JS source files for the squarepoet.github.io website.

The local branch is: `next-js-src`.
This maps to the remote branch called => `next-js-src`.

Each of our remotes (`hub`, `lab`, `bucket`) have a `master` branch and a `next-js-src` branch.

When we build, we will output files to `www` which is just a symlink to `../squarepoet.github.io.www`.

Those files will be checked into the `master` branch.

When the `master` branch is pushed to GitHub, it will automatically publish to GitHub pages.
