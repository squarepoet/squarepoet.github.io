# TODOs
- [x] Test export!
- [ ] When I refresh or go to a URL directly, it gets a 404! Something about routing?
  - [x] This does NOT happen on surge or GitHub pages! We need to configure something with the test server!
- [ ] How do I import modules with absolute URLs? I don't like seeing all the dots and slashes.
- [ ] Add trailing slash on about/ page and other similar pages.
- [ ] Add a simple component toolbar that persists between pages!
