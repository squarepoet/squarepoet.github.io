# Piano Sounds

InstrumentType.Basic sounds like a MIDI electric piano
InstrumentType.AM sounds like an organ
InstrumentType.FM sounds like an even sharper organ. How can I customize this???
InstrumentType.Sampled_1 are Ron's piano samples (from either Garage Band or PianoTeq).
InstrumentType.Sampled_2 are from https://github.com/nbrosowsky/tonejs-instruments
